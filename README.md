# Service Catalog CLI

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/service-catalog-cli.svg?style=svg&circle-token=98d6d64c981e70b76736fb3f05a0b41b4fec47cf)](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/service-catalog-cli)

This project is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with 
[Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)
resources.

| ðŸš¨  | Our releases follow [semver](https://semver.org) and the project is in **alpha** status. This means that no assurances are made about backwards compatibility or stability. Before we hit v1.0.0, breaking changes are indicated by bumping the minor version. |
|---|---|

The goal of the CLI is to provide an easy user interface for Service Catalog users
to inspect and modify the state of the resources in the system.

# Install

## Bash
```bash
curl -sLO https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/svcat
chmod +x ./svcat
mv ./svcat /usr/local/bin/
svcat --version
```

## Powershell

```powershell
iwr 'https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/Windows/x86_64/svcat.exe' -UseBasicParsing -OutFile svcat.exe
mkdir -f ~\bin
$env:PATH += ";${pwd}\bin"
svcat --version
```

The snippet above adds a directory to your PATH for the current session only. 
You will need to find a permanent location for it and add it to your PATH.

## Manual
1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system:
    * MacOS: https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/Darwin/x86_64/svcat
    * Windows: https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/Windows/x86_64/svcat.exe
    * Linux: https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/Linux/x86_64/svcat
1. Make the binary executable.
1. Move the binary to a directory on your `PATH`.
