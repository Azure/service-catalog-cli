## Test Broker Code

These packages contain code which is used to build a broker used to test the
service-catalog project.  These packages are **NOT** intended to represent a
fully up-to-date version of the API. The client library used by the service-
catalog is [here](https://github.com/pmorie/go-open-service-broker-client).

These packages are also **NOT** intended to represent a framework or library
that should be used to create new brokers or used as a client to talk to
brokers.
